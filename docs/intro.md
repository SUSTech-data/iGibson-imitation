#  iGibson: the Interactive Gibson Environment

### Large Scale Interactive Simulation Environments for Robot Learning

iGibson, the Interactive Gibson Environment, is a simulation environment providing fast visual rendering and physics simulation (based on Bullet). It is packed with a dataset with hundreds of large 3D environments reconstructed from real homes and offices, and interactive objects that can be pushed and actuated. iGibson allows researchers to train and evaluate robotic agents that use RGB images and/or other visual sensors to solve indoor (interactive) navigation and manipulation tasks such as opening doors, picking and placing objects, or searching in cabinets.

### Code Release
The GitHub repository of iGibson can be found here: [iGibson GitHub Repo](https://github.com/StanfordVL/iGibson). Bug reports, suggestions for improvement, as well as community developments are encouraged and appreciated. The support for our previous version of the environment, [Gibson v1](http://github.com/StanfordVL/GibsonEnv/), will be moved there.

### Documentation
This is the documentation webpage for iGibson. It includes installation guide (including data download), quickstart guide, code examples, and APIs.

If you want to know more about iGibson, you can also check out [our webpage](http://svl.stanford.edu/igibson), [our updated technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02924) and [our RAL+ICRA20 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14442).

### Dowloading Dataset of 3D Environments
There are several datasets of 3D reconstructed large real-world environments (homes and offices) that you can download and use with iGibson. All of them will be accessible once you fill in this <a href="https://forms.gle/36TW9uVpjrE1Mkf9A" target="_blank">[form]</a>.

You will have access to **fifteen** fully interactive environments populated with a wide variety of furniture and objects that can be actuated, and to the original 572 reconstructed, static 3D environments from [Gibson v1](http://github.com/StanfordVL/GibsonEnv/). We provide download utilities in the [installation guide](installation.md).

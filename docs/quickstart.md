# Quickstart

### iGibson in Action
Let's get our hands dirty and see iGibson in action.

```bash
cd gibson2/demo/examples
python env_example.py
```
You should see something like this:
![quickstart.png](images/quickstart.png)

The main window shows PyBullet visualization. The robot (TurtleBot) is moving around with random actions in a realistic house (called "Rs", the one you just downloaded!).

On the right hand side, you can see two windows from our mesh renderer. The top one (RobotView) shows the robot's first person view. The bottom one (ExternalView) shows the view of a virtual camera floating in the air.

If you want to have a virtual tour around the house yourself, you can click on the ExternalView window, and then translate the virtual camera to a different location by pressing "WASD" on your keyboard and rotate it to a different angle by dragging your mouse.

That's it!
